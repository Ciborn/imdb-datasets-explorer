# IMDb Datasets Explorer
The `data` folder must be filled with [IMDb dataset's TSV files](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/).

On Linux, this can be done using `./bin/sync.sh --all` to retrieve all files. You can then refresh the ratings using `./bin/sync.sh`.

## Why did I make this?
Because I wanted a fast way to have an average IMDb rating of the seasons of the series I'm watching.
